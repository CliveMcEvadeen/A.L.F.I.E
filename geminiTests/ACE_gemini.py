# This script demonstrates how a request would move through the different layers of the ACE Framework:

# 1. **Perception**: The entity perceives the world through a series of beliefs. In this example, the entity perceives that room1 is lit and room2 is not lit.
# 2. **Reasoning**: The entity reasons about the world based on its beliefs and goals. In this example, the entity infers that it needs to go to room2.
# 3. **Planning**: The entity generates a plan to achieve its goal. In this example, the entity generates a plan to go to room2.
# 4. **Action**: The entity executes the first action in its plan. In this example, the entity turns on the light in room2.

# The ACE Framework is a powerful tool for developing cognitive entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act in the world. This script demonstrates how the framework can be used to create a simple cognitive entity that can navigate its environment.
